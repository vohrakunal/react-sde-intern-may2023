**Charts, Tables, and Forms in React**  

  
## 1. Instructions

Create a web application using React to render charts, tables, and forms. (Note use the attached data)

The application shall have three pages. Each page shall be as below.

### A. Chart 
 1. Render a chart of user data whose age is greater than 30 years, and display the gender of each user.  
2. Render a chart of countries and display the count of users for each country.
  
### B. Tables
1. Render a table of user data, including the user's name, age, gender, and email address.  
2. Add an action column to the table with edit and view buttons.  
3. In the edit button, open a modal with the user's data pre-filled so that the user can edit the data.  
4. In the view button, route the user to a new page that displays the user's details.  
  
### C. Forms
1. Create a form that includes fields for the user's name, age, gender, and email address.  
2. Add validation to the form to ensure that all fields are filled out before submission.  
3. Disable the submit button until all fields are filled out.  
4. Store the data globally using a state management tool such as Redux.  
5. Render the stored data on a card.  
  
**Requirements**
1. Use a popular charting library such as Chart.js or D3.js to render the charts.  
2. Use a popular table library such as react-table or Material-UI Table to render the table.  
3. Use a popular form library such as Formik or react-hook-form to create the form.  
4. Use a popular state management tool such as Redux or MobX to store the data globally.  



## 2. Guidelines and Submission

 - Use React or React Native (Bonus)
 - check  `data.json` for mock data to be used in assignment
 - Typescript is a bonus
 - Use git for code management
 - Submit your code on a Github repository.  
 - Include a README file that describes your application and how to run it.  
 - Include screenshots or a video of your application in action.  
 - Submission timeline: 24 hrs 
 
## 3. How do we review 
We value quality over feature completeness. The aspects of your code we will assess include: 
 - Architecture 
 - Clarity 
 - Correctness 
 - Code quality 
 - Security 
 - Technical choices 


**Good luck with your assignment!**

*Bonus point: Create a mobile app and use React Native instead of Web app, Use TypeScript instead of Javascript, Production-readiness: Deployment over Heroku or similar*
